# Architect Mode Rules

## Modular Monolith Pattern
- Each module is self-contained with its own Controllers, Models, Requests, Resources, Rules, Services, UseCases
- Modules communicate via shared models in `src/Shared/Models/` (e.g., `OutboxEvent`)
- Cross-module business logic goes in `src/Shared/Services/`

## Routing Architecture
```
routes/web.php — serves welcome page only
ModuleServiceProvider — loads all module routes dynamically
Each module's routes.php — defines api/v1/<domain>/ routes
```

## Request Flow Architecture
```
Client Request
    ↓
ModuleServiceProvider (route loading)
    ↓
Controller (thin wrapper)
    ↓
FormRequest (validation)
    ↓
UseCase (orchestration)
    ↓
RulesPipeline (business rules)
    ↓
Services (business logic)
    ↓
Model + OutboxEvent (persistence)
```

## Outbox Pattern Implementation
- State changes write to `outbox_events` table in same DB transaction
- Downstream workers consume outbox events (not dispatched from UseCases)
- `sequences` table provides atomic ticket number generation

## Ticket Identifier System
- Models implement `Src\Shared\Traits\HasTicketIdentifiers`
- Must implement `getTicketPrefix(): string` (e.g., `'ORD'` for orders)
- Numbers fetched from `sequences` table under `lockForUpdate()`
- Auto-populates `ticket_code` and `ticket_number` on model `creating`

## API Response Standardization
- All responses use `ApiResponse` trait methods: `$this->success()` / `$this->error()`
- Response shape: `{ success: bool, message: string, data?: mixed }`
- `BusinessRuleException` renders itself with `error_code` field

## Module Registration
- New modules must be added to `ModuleServiceProvider::$modules` array
- Routes are loaded in order defined in the array
- Missing registration = silent failure (routes not accessible)

## Current Modules
- `Auth` — authentication (login/register)
- `Customer` — persons and companies
- `Organization` — agencies
- `Logistics/Order` — order management
- `Logistics/Payment` — payment processing
- `Shared` — cross-module utilities
